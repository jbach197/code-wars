Code Wars 07 - Disemvowel Trolls (04/18/2018)

**Author**: Jennifer Bach
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
Trolls are attacking your comment section!

A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.

Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".

Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.
